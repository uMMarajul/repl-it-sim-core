# Financial AI Assistant - Project Update

## What We've Built (So Far)
We have transformed the prototype into a fully functional visual planning tool. Here is a breakdown of what is now working:

### 1. Guided Journeys (Completed)
*   **What it does:** Instead of staring at a blank chat box, you can now click buttons to **"Set Goals"**, **"Improve Health"**, or **"Test Events"**.
*   **Why it matters:** It guides you through the process step-by-step. For example, if you choose "Test Events", the AI automatically knows to help you stress-test your plan against job loss or market crashes.

### 2. Live "Chat Charts" (Completed)
*   **What it does:** When you add a life event (like buying a house), a graph appears *inside* the chat message showing exactly how it changes your bank balance or net worth.
*   **Why it matters:** You can see the immediate impact of your decisions without leaving the conversation. Each chart acts as a "snapshot" in time, so you can scroll up and see how your plan evolved.

### 3. Visual Polish (Completed)
*   **What it does:** The app now has smooth animations, typing indicators, and better styling.
*   **Why it matters:** It feels like a finished product, not a developer prototype.

### 4. Smart Scenario Engine (Completed)
*   **What it does:** The system can now handle complex financial requests like:
    *   "I inherited £5,000" (Windfalls)
    *   "I need to take out a £10k loan" (Debt)
    *   "I need to withdraw cash from my savings" (Withdrawals)
*   **Why it matters:** You aren't limited to just "buying things". You can model real-life financial complexity.

## How It Works (Simplified)
The system connects our **Simulation Engine** (the math) with an **AI Coach** (the logic):
1.  **It Reads Your Plan:** The AI constantly checks your current age, income, and savings.
2.  **It Listens to You:** You type a goal in plain English (e.g., "I want to retire at 55").
3.  **It Updates the Math:** The AI converts your words into settings and updates the simulation instantly.

## 🛠️ For Contributors
**Key Files to Watch:**
*   [api/agent_service.py](file:///c:/Users/harri/Downloads/replit-sim-core/replit-sim-core/api/agent_service.py): Main AI logic, prompt definitions, and parameter extraction.
*   [app-ui/src/config/configTransformers.ts](file:///c:/Users/harri/Downloads/replit-sim-core/replit-sim-core/app-ui/src/config/configTransformers.ts): Logic that converts simplified UI data into complex Simulation Modifiers. **(Heavily modified in Phase 4b)**.
*   [sim-core/src/config/scenarioRegistryData.ts](file:///c:/Users/harri/Downloads/replit-sim-core/replit-sim-core/sim-core/src/config/scenarioRegistryData.ts): Metadata definitions for all scenarios.

**Running the Stack:**
1.  **Frontend**: `npm run dev` (Port 5001)
2.  **Backend**: `python -m uvicorn api.agent_service:app --reload --port 8000`

**Environment:**
Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables.
