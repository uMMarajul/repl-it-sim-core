## Planning Phase
- [x] Design AI agent architecture
- [x] Define agent capabilities and constraints
- [x] Plan API/LLM integration approach
- [x] Design goal recommendation logic
- [x] Plan custom goal generation workflow
- [x] Define input/output formats

## Implementation Planning
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan
- [x] Review and iterate with user
- [x] Finalize approach and tech stack

## Phase 1: Foundation (OpenAI + Profile Extraction)
- [/] Install OpenAI SDK
- [ ] Create AI agent types and interfaces
- [ ] Build LLM client abstraction layer
- [ ] Create profile extraction prompt
- [ ] Implement profile extraction service
- [ ] Build basic chat UI component
- [ ] Test profile extraction end-to-end

## Phase 2: Recommendation Engine
- [ ] Expand rules engine with more scenarios
- [ ] Create scenario recommendation prompts
- [ ] Build hybrid recommender (rules + AI)
- [ ] Add explanation generation
- [ ] Test recommendations with sample profiles

## Phase 3: Custom Scenario Generation
- [ ] Create custom scenario generation prompts
- [ ] Build scenario validator
- [ ] Add intelligent parameter suggestion
- [ ] Test with edge cases
